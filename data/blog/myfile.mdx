## Why Hugo

Among all the other Static Site Generators I chose Hugo for a reason. Hugo is exceptionally fast in [content-based web development](#), providing rapid 'build times' and efficient rendering of static websites. Its speed is attributed to its use of ['Go' programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)) and its focus on delivering quick, high-performance results for content-driven sites.

Hugo is build Built with Go, providing a different technology stack compared to the [JavaScript-based React frameworks](#). It is primarily a static site generator, which pre-renders pages at build time, resulting in fast-loading, efficient websites. In a very short span of time Hugo established its identity for exceptional speed due to its simplicity and focus on [static site generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator).


## Markdown First

From now on my  primary focus will be on writing content using the [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) markup language before considering other formatting or styling concerns. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that uses plain text formatting syntax to create structured documents. The [Markdown first](#) philosophy encourages me to focus on the content itself, using simple and easy-to-write plain text with minimal distractions. 

Once the content is written and structured using 'Markdown', it can be later converted into various formats, such as [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), for presentation on the web or other mediums. 

This approach is particularly popular in scenarios where content is intended for digital platforms, blogs, documentation, or collaborative writing environments. [Markdown's simplicity](#) allows for quick and efficient writing without the need for extensive formatting knowledge, and it also ensures content is easily portable and can be adapted to different platforms and styles.

## Go Lang

'Go' is designed for simplicity and readability, minimizing complex syntax and providing a clean and concise language structure. Go has 'built-in' support for concurrent programming, making it easy to create efficient and concurrent applications. Go offers fast 'compilation times', enabling quick development cycles and efficient deployment of applications.
    
Automatic [garbage collection](https://chayandatta.medium.com/garbage-collection-in-go-959b4c164c42) simplifies 'memory management', reducing the risk of memory leaks and improving developer productivity. Go is [statically typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Statically_typed_programming_languages), providing strong type-checking at `compile-time` for increased code reliability. Go includes a testing framework as part of its standard library, promoting test-driven development practices.
    
**Basic Go Code Structure:**

```go

package main
import  "fmt"  
func main() { 
// Entry point of the program
fmt.Println("Hello, Golang!") 
}

```

## Quick Start

If you have not installed hugo [here](https://gohugo.io/installation/) is the official documentation you can follow. This guide assumes that you have installed hugo in your local machine and [created hugo site](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#create-a-site) from the command line with 'hugo new site sitename'.
To integrate the [Hugo theme](hugo.io/themes) into your Hugo site, follow these step-by-step instructions:
